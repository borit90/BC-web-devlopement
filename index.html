                <h2> About us at BC Web Development</h2>
                <p> Hello, I'd like to take the chance to welcome you all to our Website. I am a new upcoming web developer with CSS and HTML experience so I can make the website of your dreams become reality. I also have experience in Sass and Bootstrap and also node.js meaning I am flexible in my approach to web design.</p>
                <p> The process we go through is really simple, You tell me what you are looking for in a website, features and layoouts you like and I will then incorporate your ideas into my coding to give you the website you've always wanted.</p>
                <h3> A little bit about me...</h3>
                <p> I am a 31 year old who has always had a keen interest in computers and IT. I gained an A level in ICT during my time at sixth form, and now I am looking to pursue a career in IT. I have completed an online course called "Complete Web Design For Beginners" which has given me the knowledge, skills and understanding to present this website to you. I am looking to complete further courses within the not to distant future to further broaden my horizons and knowledge to allow me to do even more!! </p>
                <p> I am based on the outskirts of Essex and currently looking to design websites for people to gain more experience and build up a portfolio of websites that both me and the customer can be 100% satisfied with!</p>
                <P> I will then also use caniuse.com which is a free website which will let me know as a designer how compatible my website design and features is with your customers to ensure a maximum number of viewers see your website perfectly!</P>
